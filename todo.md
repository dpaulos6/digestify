## Todo List for Digestify Features!

### Hashing Tools

- [x] **Basic String Hashing:** Hash any string with various algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.
- [ ] **File Integrity Check:** Upload a file and generate its hash to verify integrity using MD5, SHA-256, etc.
- [ ] **Batch File Hashing:** Upload multiple files and generate their hashes at once.
- [ ] **Checksum Verification:** Compare a file's hash with a provided checksum to verify its integrity.

### **Secret and Key Generation**

- [x] **Random Secret Generator:** Generate random strings of a specified length and character set (alphanumeric, special characters, etc.).
- [x] **UUID Generator:** Generate Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).
- [x] **Cryptographic Key Generator:** Generate keys for symmetric encryption (AES) and asymmetric encryption (RSA).
- [x] **Password Generator:** Create secure, random passwords with customizable options (length, character types, etc.).

### **Encryption and Decryption Tools**

- [ ] **Encrypt and Decrypt Text:** Use symmetric algorithms like AES, DES, and Blowfish to encrypt and decrypt text.
- [ ] **File Encryption/Decryption:** Encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric encryption.
- [ ] **Public and Private Key Pair Generation:** Generate public and private key pairs for RSA and ECC.
- [ ] **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages:** Use public/private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.

### **Encoding and Decoding Tools**

- [x] **Base64/Base32/Base58 Encoding/Decoding:** Encode and decode text and files in Base64, Base32 or Base58.

<!--

To be decided

- [ ] **URL Encode:** Convert text to URL-encoded format.
- [ ] **URL Decode:** Convert URL-encoded text back to normal text.

-->

### **Miscellaneous Tools**

- [ ] **Hash Comparison Tool:** Compare two hashes to check if they are identical.
- [ ] **Brute Force Hash Cracker:** Attempt to crack a hash using brute force (for educational purposes, ensuring compliance with legal and ethical guidelines).
- [ ] **Dictionary Attack:** Use a dictionary of common passwords to attempt to crack a hash.
- [ ] **Generate Checksums:** Create checksums for data integrity verification.
- [ ] **Verify Checksums:** Compare generated checksums with provided values.

### **Educational Resources**
